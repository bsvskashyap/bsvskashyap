**AI/ML Engineer & Researcher â€” Building ML Systems that Ship**

With 4+ years of experience, I specialize in deploying deep learning and MLOps pipelines (PyTorch, TensorFlow, MLflow) that transform massive, complex datasets into scalable, production-ready solutions. My work delivers measurable impactâ€”cutting processing time from days to hours, and enabling real advances in research and operations.

**Highlights**
- Developed wildfire damage assessment using U-Net/U-Net-GRU (NASA GeoAI project), lifting accuracy by 10%
- Built GANs in PyTorch for super-resolution (30m â†’ 3m imagery) in disaster monitoring
- Created ICTV Visual Taxonomy Browser (D3.js), now used globally, boosting engagement and research conversion
- Improved donor retention (+14%) and ROI (+10%) via predictive modeling and interactive dashboards

**Technical Stack**
- ML/DL: scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, NLP, Computer Vision
- MLOps/Cloud: MLflow, FastAPI, Airflow, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, Google Earth Engine
- Data Engineering: Spark, Snowflake, BigQuery, ETL, SQL
- Visualization: Power BI, Tableau, D3.js, QGIS, ArcGIS

**Actively seeking AI/ML engineering roles** where I can deliver production solutions with real-world impact. Open to full-time, research, and consulting opportunities.
